Updates log 

2021 12/22 -> configuerd Basic webpage to introduce myself , need to add contents.



2021 12/24 fri -> Configured LAMP system settings ,  changed web hosting program from caddy to Apache2. 
                          Caddy had to use the preset names like index.html for their first page, but apache2 just need to define the path for the first page in the .conf file.
                          Compared to caddy , apache2 does not have ip binding 127.0.0.1 as  a default, but need to enable socket 80 to Listen.

                          Mysql installed with authentication , need password to access it.currently didn't make it only accessable on local host 
                          //TODO : design a databse and upload a uml for it.  The table is for user authentication in my webpage. (will add a login button)
                          // connect a database hadling tool with it.-> connect a Datagrip.
                          //Current status for mysql : only downloaded it, need to add a account for outer client to access.
                          
                          Maked a  simbolic link file from /var/www -> /workspace and /workspace is linked to ~/workspace so that every user can share the workspace. 
                        //TODO : Need to add a group for granting the permission of this workspace file. only my Ipad ssh client and mac ssh client can access to it 
                         //TODO : Update 12/25 :  also need to add a password for root user // sudo su root can be accessed without entering a password. 
                          Learned how to read the config file. 
                        //TODO : set the vim envrionment globally so that I can use it also for the mac ssh client. Learn the vim extensions. (currently available only in ipad client)




2021 12/25 sat -> Added https certification using Let's encript (ssl certificte , using certbot)
                            Leraned about difference between http and https, DNS spoofing (security problem) and 80/433 port (used for http/https) , log files under the /var/log directory.
                            < https is using the private key and public key to  encript the connection >
                           
                            Modified the file structure in the /etc/apache2. Apache can host different webpages, so I added the dir for codeforlee.com and configured the settings. 
                            Also changed the config file so that it can redirect to https file ( although it is accessed to the 80  socket)
                           
                           //TODO :  Will add update list in the webpage -> using react.js ( js library ) // will learn more about  frameworks.
